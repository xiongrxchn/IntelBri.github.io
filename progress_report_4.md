There are three kinds of defeats: Cracking, Pot Holes and Upheaval.

#### Cracking
Refering to a variety of types of pavement distresses that occur on the surface of pavements. Different types of pavements develop different cracks. Type of cracking is also correlated with the type of climate and traffic.

#### Upheaval
Localized upward movement in a pavement due to swelling of the subgrade. This can be due to expansive soils that swell due to moisture or frost heave (ice under the pavement).

#### Potholes
Missing chunks of pavement, severely sunk in or protruding manhole covers, other significant road surface anomalies.

#### Smooth road
Segments of road surface that are considered smooth.

## Future Plan
- Complie all sensors together and test the system under outdoor environments.
