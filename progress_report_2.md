# Progress Report 2 (Oct 8th)


## Current progress

### Narrow down the goal of project




## Problems Encountered

### (1) How to set up the experiment environments?
We can set up our experiments on real scenarios or simulated bridges. Collecting real bridge data may require some restricted safety permissions from the bridge management institutes. So we may establish simulated experimental environments to collect sensor data. We have chosen some bridge models online, as shown in the Figure. We then must figure out how to add different vehicle loads on the bridge to simulate the vibration features of bridges?




## Future Plan
- Build the simulated physical models of the bridge and install the sensors on the suitable locations of the bridge.
- determine the appropriate sampling frequencies for both sensors and finish the control part of the codes.
- Connect all sensors to OpenChirp and remove the anomaly signals.
- Analyze the collected signals and identify the alrmaing cases.
