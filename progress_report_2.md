# Progress Report 2 (Oct 8th)


## Current progress

### Narrow down the goal of project

Due to monitoring the bridge vibration requiring high sampling frequencies, the sampling frequencies of Raspberry Pi is not sufficient.
We would focus on part of the bridge health monitoring, for example, the bridge road surface monitoring.

We investigates an application of mobile sensing: detecting and reporting the surface conditions of roads. We describe a system
and associated algorithms to monitor this important bridge using a collection of sensor-equipped vehicles. In specific, uses the inherent mobility of the participating vehicles, opportunistically gathering data from vibration and GPS sensors, and processing the data to assess road surface conditions.



## Problems Encountered

### (1) How to set up the experiment environments?
We can set up our experiments on real scenarios or simulated bridges. Collecting real bridge data may require some restricted safety permissions from the bridge management institutes. So we may establish simulated experimental environments to collect sensor data. We have chosen some bridge models online, as shown in the Figure. We then must figure out how to add different vehicle loads on the bridge to simulate the vibration features of bridges?




## Future Plan
- Build the simulated physical models of the bridge and install the sensors on the suitable locations of the bridge.
