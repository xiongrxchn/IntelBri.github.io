# IoT based Bridge Health Monitoring Evaluating System

• Pengkun Liu; Ruoxin Xiong


## Introduction

```markdown
The transportation infrastructure is quickly aging. Increases in traffic, in both urban and rural areas, puts more strain on the bridge networks than was originally intended. Bridge engineers need a reliable way to assess structural integrity of bridges to maintain the continuous operation of the road network while ensuring the safety of the public [1]. Traditional visual inspection techniques are both time consuming and expensive. They are also qualitative and can only assess outward appearance. Any internal damage may go unnoticed for a long period of time. According to the 2020 bridge reports from the Federal Highway Administration [2], more than one third (37 percent) of U.S. bridges—nearly 231,000 spans—need repair work. More than 46,000 bridges are rated in poor condition and classified as “structurally deficient.” A total of 81,000 bridges should be replaced. How does a bridge engineer keep track of these problems? A possible solution to these issues is the use of an Internet of Things (IoT) based structural health monitoring system. These systems can detect changes in the bridge superstructure and, in some cases, predict impending failures. These systems can monitor bridges in real time and warn state engineers of possible problems to avoid tragedies like the I-35W collapse in August 2007.
```

## Motivation

The challenges of a deteriorating and aged infrastructure continue to challenge transportation authorities as they align maintenance and replacement priorities with decreasing funds. The United States is home to nearly 600,000 highway bridges of which nearly 12% are structurally deficient. 

No single structural health monitoring (SHM) method exists that is capable of completely determining the condition of a bridge. Current assessment methods provide critical information about the condition of a bridge, but the data obtained must be interpreted by a skilled professional and are typically limited to local metrics.

IoT technologies offer the ability to combine several methods to obtain a more complete assessment. Currently, these methods will provide a better picture of the overall bridge condition.
